------------------
* Added the shared two-process policy runtime with ``main-runtime`` and ``engine-process`` services.
* Refactored LeRobot and GR00T backends onto the shared runtime, replacing the backend-local inference server and control publisher split.
* Added schema-driven ``RobotClient`` runtime configuration for cameras, joint groups, sensor-backed state, and command publishers.
* Added action chunk buffering and command publishing through ``ActionChunkProcessor`` and ``RobotClient.publish_action``.
* Added LeRobot backend loading, IO mapping, preprocessing, prediction, and optimization modules for policy-container inference.
* Added GR00T N1.7 deployment support, camera mapping, smoke checks, and runtime tests.
